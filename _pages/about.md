Our company name comes from the phrase "All Things are Possible".  Ok, maybe that's hyperbole, but... what can we say, we love a challenge.

Our name is also inspired by the <a href="https://biologydictionary.net/atp/">ATP molecule</a>.<br />

We are a small development shop started by two brothers.  We are longtime software developers, but relatively new to our latest area of focus: mobile app development.  We like to build quality software that is both easy to use and highly customizable - a combination that can be challenging to pull off.

Our first app is a todo list app for iOS: <a href="http://jadetasks.com">Jade Tasks</a>.  It's a labor of love that we use ourselves every day.

No Test [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
